                        <p class="festival-description">The “black gold” of Burgos, Porphyra Marcosii, a species of seaweed found in northernmost Luzon, locally called “gamet”, was named after the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos. This purplish, blackish seaweed grows abundantly in the intertidal zone on the rocks and barnacles from November to March when the Northwest monsoon brings rainshowers, cold winds and big waves. Today, gamet has a high market demand not just because it has become a gourmet's delight but it is  known to contain high percentage of protein, iodine and vitamins A, B & C. Porphyra production in Ilocos remains underdeveloped because of lack of technology and resources. However, because it holds a better promise for a better livelihood, fisherfolks abandon fishing as they are attracted to gamet harvesting which is more profitable, even though it is a hazardous occupation.

                        For the adventurous, especially those in search for gustatory delights, Burgos is the town to visit. This picturesque town holds an annual festival to celebrate the uniquely delectable black gold of Ilocos; the gamet, which has acquired a celebrity status. The festival held in May includes parades with floats, street dancing and other forms of entertainment. The highlight of this celebration is the feasting on gamet dishes and other signature Ilocano dishes. This is an event you will always remember along with a lasting impression of the warm hospitality of the Ilocanos.</p>
